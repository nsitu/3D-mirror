# Overview
While hiking in Ontario I encounter landmarks of stacked stones marking the way. They remind me that I share the trail (and the land itself) with others: those who came before and those who will follow after. In particular they invite an awareness of inuksuk and innunguaq as enduring Inuit symbols.


“We are happy that others appreciate our symbols but we do not want the meaning taken out of our symbols. Inuit have used the inuksuk for survival and assign a lot of value to its preservation”

# An Invitation
I have found the "mirror" logic of this sketch to be provocative and surprising. It has led me to be more curious about my relationship with the world around me. I invite you to adapt the code for your own explorations.
